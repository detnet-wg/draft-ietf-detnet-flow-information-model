<section title="Introduction">
        
     <t>
        Deterministic Networking (DetNet) provides a capability to carry
        specified unicast or multicast data flows for real-time applications
        with extremely low packet loss rates and assured maximum end-to-end
        delivery latency.  A description of the general background and concepts
        of DetNet can be found in <xref target="I-D.ietf-detnet-architecture"/>.
     </t>
     <t>
        This document describes the Detnet Flow Service Information Model. 
        For reference <xref target="RFC3444"/> describes the rational behind Information
	Models in general. This document describes the Flow and Service information
	models for operators and users to understand Detnet services, and for implementors
        as a guide to the functionality required by Detnet services.
    </t>
     <t>
        The DetNet Architecture treats the DetNet related data plane functions
        decomposed into two sub-layers: a service sub-layer and a forwarding
        sub-layer.  The service sub-layer is used to provide DetNet service
        protection and reordering. The forwarding sub-layer provides
        resource allocation (to ensure low loss, assured latency, and limited
        out-of-order delivery) and leverages Traffic Engineering mechanisms.
      </t>
      <t> 
        In the IETF DetNet service utilizes IP or MPLS and DetNet is currently
        defined for IP and MPLS networks as shown in Figure 1 based on Figure 2
        and Figure 3 of <xref target="I-D.ietf-detnet-data-plane-framework"/>. 
        IEEE 802.1 Time Sensitive Networking (TSN) utilizes Ethernet and
        is defined over Ethernet networks.  A DetNet flow includes one or more
        App-flow(s) as payload. App-flows can be Ethernet, MPLS, or IP flows,
        which impacts which header fields are utilized to identify a flow.
        DetNet flows are identified by the DetNet encapsulation of App-flow(s) (e.g.,
        MPLS labels, IP 6-tuple etc.). In some scenarios App-flow and DetNet
        flow look similar on the wire (e.g., L3 App-flow over a DetNet IP
        network).  </t>

        As shown in <xref target="dn_svc_encaps"/> as per <xref
                target="I-D.ietf-detnet-data-plane-framework"/> a DetNet flow
        can be treated as an application level flow (App-flow) e.g., at DetNet
        flow aggregation or in a sub-network that interconnects DetNet nodes.
    </t>        

    <t>
        The DetNet flow and service information model provided by this document
        contains both DetNet flow and App-flow specific information in an
        integrated fashion.  
    </t>
    <t>In a given network scenario three information models can distinguished:
        
    <list style="symbols">

    <t>
        Flow models that describe characteristics of data flows. These models
        describe in detail all relevant aspects of a flow that are needed to
        support the flow properly by the network between the source and the
        destination(s). 
     </t> 
        <t> 
        Service models that describe characteristics of services being provided
        for data flows over a network. These models can be treated as a network
        operator independent information model.  
       </t> 
        <t>
        Configuration models that describe in detail the settings required on
        network nodes to provide a data flow proper service.  
       </t>
       </list>
       </t>
        
        <t>
         Service and flow information models are used between the user and the
         network operator. Configuration information models are used between
         the management/control plane entity of the network and the network
         nodes. They are shown in <xref target="fig_infomodels"/>.

        DetNet flow and service information model is based on <xref
                target="I-D.ietf-detnet-architecture"/> and on the concept of
        data model specified by <xref target="IEEE8021Qcc"/>. Furthermore, the
        origination of the DetNet flow information model was the flow
        identification possibilities described in <xref target="IEEE8021CB"/>,
        which is used by <xref target="IEEE8021Qcc"/> as well. In addition to
        the TSN data model, <xref target="IEEE8021Qcc"/> also specifies
        configuration of TSN features (e.g., traffic scheduling specified by
        <xref target="IEEE8021Qbv"/>). The common architecture and flow
        model, allow configured features to be consistent in certain deployment
        scenarios, e.g., when the network that provides the DetNet service
        includes both L3 and L2 network segments.  
      </t> 
        
<!--        <t>Based on the DetNet architecture <xref target="I-D.ietf-detnet-architecture"/> (see Section 4), this document (this revision) only considers the Centralized Network / Distributed User Model out of the models specified by <xref target="IEEE8021Qcc"/>. That is, there is a User-Network Interface (UNI) between an end system and a network. Furthermore, there is a central entity for the control of the network. For instance, the central entity implements a Path Computation Element (PCE) for the calculation and establishment of paths needed for packet replication and elimination, if any.
</t> -->
        
        <section title="Goals">
                <t>
          As expressed in the <xref target="IETFDetNet"/> Charter, the DetNet
          WG collaborates with IEEE 802.1 TSN in order to define a common
          architecture for both Layer 2 and Layer 3. This is beneficial for
          several reasons, e.g., in order to simplify implementations and
          maintain consistency across diverse networks. The flow and service
          information models are also aligned for those reasons. Therefore, the
          DetNet flow and service information models described in this document
          are based on <xref target="IEEE8021Qcc"/>, which is an amendment to
          <xref target="IEEE8021Q"/>.</t>
           
<!--           <t>The Centralized Network / Distributed User Model of <xref target="IEEE8021Qcc"/> is used in this revision as a start of the work. Further models can be also useful for DetNet, e.g., the Fully Centralized Model for the Industrial M2M use case <xref target="RFC8578"/>.</t>
-->
          
           <t>
               This document specifies flow and service information models only.
           </t>
        </section>

        <section title="Non Goals">
           <t>
           This document (this revision) does not specify flow data models or
           DetNet configuration. Therefore, the goals of this document
           differ from the goals of <xref target="IEEE8021Qcc"/>, which also
           specifies the TSN data model and configuration of certain TSN features.

<section anchor="sec_modeling" title="DetNet Domain and its Modeling">

 <section anchor="sec_soverview" title="DetNet Service Overview">
        <t> 
          The DetNet service can be defined as a service that provides a
          capability to carry a unicast or a multicast data flow for an
          application with constrained requirements on network performance,
          e.g., low packet loss rate and/or latency.  
        </t>
        <t> 
          Figure 5 and Figure 8 in <xref
                  target="I-D.ietf-detnet-architecture"/> show the DetNet
          service related reference points and main components.  
        </t>
 </section>

 <section anchor="sec_srefpoints" title="Reference Points Used in Modeling">
         <t> 
          From service design perspective a fundamental question is the
          location of the service/flow endpoints, i.e., where the service/flow
          starts and ends.  
        </t>
        <t> 
          App-flow specific reference points are the Source (where it starts)
          and the Destination (where it terminates). Similarly a DetNet flow
          has reference points termed DN Ingress (where a DetNet flow starts) and DN
          Egress (where a DetNet flow ends). These reference points may coexist in the
          same node (e.g., in a DetNet IP end system). DN Ingress and DN Egress
          reference points are intermediate reference points for a served
          App-flow.  
        </t>
        <t>
          All reference points are assumed in this document to be packet-based
          reference points. A DN Ingress may add and a DN Egress may remove
          networking technology specific encapsulation to/from the served
          App-flow(s) (e.g., MPLS label(s), UDP and IP headers).  
  </t>
 </section>

 <section anchor="sec_sinfoelements" title="Information Elements">
         <t> 
         The DetNet flow information model and the service model relies on
         three groups of information elements: 
         <list style="symbols">
         <t>
           App-flow related parameters: these describe the App-flow
           characteristics (e.g., identification, encapsulation, traffic
           specification, endpoints, status, etc.) and the App-flow
           service expectations (e.g., delay, loss, etc.).  
         </t>
         <t>
           DetNet flow related parameters: these describe the DetNet flow
           characteristics (e.g., identification, format, traffic
           specification, endpoints, rank, etc.).  
         </t>
         <t>
           DetNet service related parameters: these describe the expected
           service characteristics (e.g., delivery type, connectivity
           delay/loss, status, rank, etc.).  
          </t>
         </list>
        </t>
        
        <t> 
          In the information model a DetNet flow contains one or more (aggregated) App-flows
          (N:1 mapping). During DetNet aggregation the aggregated DetNet flows
          are treated simply as App-flows and the aggregate is the DetNet flow, which
          provides N:1 mapping. Similarly, there is an aggregated many to one relationship for 
          the DetNet flow(s) to the DetNet Service.

        When Deterministic service is required by time/loss sensitive

<section anchor="sec_dnflow" title="DetNet Flow Related Parameters">

        <t>
        The Data model specified by <xref target="IEEE8021Qcc"/> describes data
        flows using TSN service as periodic flows with fix packet size (i.e.,
        Constant Bit Rate (CBR) flows) or with variable packet size. The same
        concept is applied for flows using DetNet service.
        </t>
        
        <t>
        Latency and loss parameters are correlated because the effect of late
        delivery can result data loss for an application. However, not all
        applications require hard limits on both latency and loss.
        For example, some real-time applications allow graceful degradation if
        loss happens (e.g., sample-based data processing, media distribution). Some
        other applications may require high-bandwidth connections that make use of
        packet replication techniques which are economically challenging or even
        impossible. Some applications may not tolerate loss, but are not
        delay sensitive (e.g., bufferless sensors). Time or loss sensitive
        applications may have somewhat special requirements especially for loss
        (e.g., no loss over two consecutive communication cycles; very low outage
        time, etc.).</t>

          MaxLatency is the maximum latency from Ingress to Egress(es) for a
          single packet of the DetNet flow. MaxLatency is specified as an
          integer number of nanoseconds. 
          <!-- This is TSN (Qcc) specific mechanism:  When this requirement is specified by the Ingress, it has to be

          the network provides in the AccumulatedLatency parameter of the Status object 
          (<xref target="sec_dnservstat"/>) after the successful configuration of the flow, 
          such that any subsequent increase in the latency beyond that initial value

   <section anchor="sec_maxloss" title="Maximum Loss of the DetNet Service">
         <t>
         MaxLoss defines the maximum Packet Loss Ratio (PLR) parameter for the
         DetNet service between the Ingress and Egress(es) of the DetNet
         domain.

           Some applications have special loss requirement, such as
           MaxConsecutiveLossTolerance.  The maximum consecutive loss tolerance
           parameter describes the maximum number of consecutive packets whose

           that can be received out of order. The maximum allowed misordering
           can be measured for example based on sequence number. The value zero
           for the maximum allowed misordering indicates that in order delivery
           is required, misordering cannot be tolerated.

          Two connectivity types are distinguished: point-to-point (p2p) and
          point-to-multipoint (p2mp). Connectivity type p2mp is created by a
          transport layer function (e.g., p2mp LSP). (Note: mp2mp connectivity
          is a superposition of p2mp connections.)</t>

        <t>The DetNet flow information model relies on three high level information groups:
           <list style="symbols">
                   <t>
              DnIngress: The DnIngress information group includes elements that
              specify the source for a single DetNet flow. This information
              group is applied from the user of the DetNet service to the
              network.
              </t> 
              <t>
              DnEgress: The DnEgress information group includes elements that
              specify the destination for a single DetNet flow.  This
              information group is applied from the user of the DetNet
              service to the network.
              </t>
              <t>
              DnFlowStatus: The status information group includes elements that
              specify the status of the flow in the network. This information
              group is applied from the network to the user of the DetNet
              service. This information group informs the user whether or not
              the DetNet flow is ready for use.
              </t> 
             </list>
        </t>

        <t> 
             There are three possible operations for each DetNet flow with
             respect to its DetNet service at a DN Ingress or a DN Egress
             (similarly to App-flows at a Source or a Destination): 
<?rfc subcompact="yes" ?>
             <list style="symbols">
              <t>Join: DN Ingress/DN Egress intends to join the flow.</t>
              <t>Leave: DN Ingress/DN Egress intends to leave the flow.</t>
              <t>Modify: DN Ingress/DN Egress intends to change the flow.</t>
           </list>
<?rfc subcompact="no" ?>
        </t>        

  <section anchor="sec_flowjoin" title="Join Operation">
          <t>
          For the join operation, the DnFlowSpecification, DnFlowRank,
          DnFlowEndpoint, and DnTrafficSpecification SHALL be included within
          the DnIngress or DnEgress information group. For the join operation,
          the DnServiceRequirements groups MAY be included.
          </t>
  </section>

  <section anchor="sec_flowleave" title="Leave Operation">
  <t>For the leave operation, the DnFlowSpecification and DnFlowEndpoint SHALL 
  be included within the DnIngress or DnEgress information group.</t>
  </section>

  <section anchor="sec_flowmodify" title="Modify Operation">
    <t>For the modify operation, the DnFlowSpecification, DnFlowRank, DnFlowEndpoint,
        and DnTrafficSpecification SHALL be included within the DnIngress or DnEgress 
        information group. For the join operation, the DnServiceRequirements groups 
        MAY be included.
        </t>
        <t>
        The Modify operation can be considered to address cases when a flow is
        slightly changed, e.g., only MaxPayloadSize (<xref
                target="sec_dntrafficspec"/>) has been changed. The advantage
        of having a Modify is that it allows initiation of a change of flow spec
        while leaving the current flow is operating until the change is
        accepted. If there is no linkage between the Join and the Leave, then
        while figuring out whether the new flow spec can be supported, the
        controller entity has to assume that the resources committed to the
        current flow are in use. By using Modify the controller entity knows that
        the resources supporting the current flow can be available for
        supporting the altered flow. Modify is considered to be an optional
        operation due to possible controller plane limitations.
